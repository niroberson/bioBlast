Nathan Roberson Week 1 Update

This Week:

Met with Kevin Peng to discuss project goals and timeline.
Got access to shadowfax - still waiting on others, submitted another ticket
Started writing python code for text feature extraction and comparison
	- removing "stop words" from entries
	- using word stems to combine different tenses of the same word
	- Using term frequency - inverse document frequency to normalize entry vectors
	- Using cosine similarity to get most similar documents

Next Week:

Extend software to compute cosine similarity vectors for entire corpus then sort resulting table
Run software on portions of medline database and compare results to current deja vu database
